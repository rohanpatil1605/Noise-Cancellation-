This MATLAB code is a robust implementation of noise cancellation techniques using Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. Specifically tailored for small electronic devices like affordable earphones, the code addresses the common challenge of mitigating background noise to enhance overall audio quality.

In technical terms, the script begins by setting parameters such as sampling frequency, recording duration, and filter order. It then generates a synthetic noise sample, simulating real-world environmental interference. FIR and IIR filters are designed and applied to the recorded audio signal, showcasing the efficiency of these filtering techniques in reducing unwanted noise components.

The script not only performs the noise cancellation but also incorporates audio playback and signal plotting, allowing engineers to assess the results both audibly and visually. This serves as a valuable tool for engineers working on small electronics projects, providing practical insights into the implementation of noise reduction techniques for an elevated user experience in affordable earphones
